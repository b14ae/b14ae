		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>Our mission is simple: to rescue, rehabillitate, and rehome animals while promoting responsible pet ownership and animal welfare within our community. We believe that every animal deserves a chance at a happy and fulfilling life.</p>
		
		<h2>Our story</h2>
		<p>We have been helping animals in need since 1925. Our animal shelter has been a pillar of support for countless animals who have faced abandonment, neglect, or abuse. We have witnessed the power of love and compasssion in healing these animals and giving them a second chance.</p>
		<br>
		<p>This animal shelter has saved over 76275 dogs and cats since we started in 1925.  Every one of them has left little paw prints on our hearts, and we remember all of them fondly.  We have an active alumni community and we're so grateful every time someone chooses to join our community.</p>
